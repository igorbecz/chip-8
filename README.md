What is chip-8?
- Acording to wikipedia: "CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC 
VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was
made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers." [1]
